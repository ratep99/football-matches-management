## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Java 11** or higher
- **Node.js** and **npm/yarn**
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd football-events-backend
   ```

2. **Build the backend**:
   ```sh
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```sh
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```sh
   cd ../football-events-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### MySQL Database Setup with Docker

1. **Navigate to the root directory** containing the Docker Compose file.

2. **Run Docker Compose** to set up the MySQL container:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access MySQL** via any MySQL client tool using the connection details from `docker-compose.yml`.

### Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` includes configuration for a MySQL instance, ensuring all database operations are containerized.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  db:
    image: mysql:8
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
      MYSQL_DATABASE: football_events_db
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
  db_data:
```

## Database Diagram

The MySQL database is designed following the **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to ensure efficient data storage and eliminate redundancy. Below is the ER diagram representing the core entities:

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Introduce role-based access to manage administrative privileges.
- **Team Management Module**: Allow admins to create and manage teams, including updating rosters.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Add a dashboard for visualizing statistics such as total goals, cards, and other metrics.
